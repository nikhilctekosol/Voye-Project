                        <strong>Cancellation Policy:</strong><br>
                        Cancellations are non-refundable. Once a booking is confirmed, no refund will be issued regardless of the cancellation reason. To cancel a booking, please notify us in writing or by phone. Although we do not require a detailed reason for cancellation, your feedback would help us enhance our services.

                        <strong>Rescheduling Policy:</strong><br>
                        Instead of cancelling, you may reschedule your booking to a future date, subject to availability. Rescheduling requests must be made at least 10 days before the check-in date. Rescheduling is not permitted within 10 days of check-in.

                    <p>We strive to make your holiday dreams come true, but in certain circumstances, we may need to cancel a confirmed booking due to:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In such cases, a full refund of the booking amount collected will be processed, but Voye Homes will not be liable for any incidental expenses such as flight tickets, transportation charges, or optional tours.</p>
